This plugin will extract all particles of a specific
type and write them out as single events to an HDDM 
file. The particles are taken from the DMCThrown objects
and therefore represent the generated particles (not
the reconstructed particles).

This is useful for studying the detector response
to particles with a distribution determined by the input
file, but in a simpler event structure that is not
cluttered by multiple particles.

For example, to get pull all of the neutrons out of
a file of events produced by bggen (pythia) do the
following:

hd_ana -PPLUGINS=extract_ptype_hddm -PPTYPE=13 bggen.hddm

This will produce a file called "neutron.hddm" because the
GEANT particle type for neutrons is 13.

See src/libraries/include/particleType.h for a list of
particle types.

There are 3 configuration parameters this plugin uses:

PTYPE: Used to set the type of particle one wants to extract

OUTPUTFILENAME: name of the output file. If not set, the
filename will be based on the particle type

VERTEX: Used to specify the vertex of the particle. Note
that any vertex in the input file is ignored. This should
be specified as a string with 4 numbers representing the
X, Y, Zmin, and Zmax values. If Zmin and Zmax are different,
the represent a span from which the vertex will be 
randomly chose for every particle. An example is:

hd_ana -PVERTEX="0 0 50 80" -PPLUGINS=extract_ptype_hddm bggen.hddm

this would randomly select a vertex on the beamline in the 
range of the full 30cm GlueX target.
