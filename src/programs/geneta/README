This directory contains files for the eta Primakoff generator
originally authored by Ashot Gasparian. It has been modified 
to be used as a stand-alone program that writes out HDDM files
suitable as input to hdgeant.

The program reads some of its configuration from the eta_p_gen.dat
file which needs to be in the current directory when the 
program is run.

Run geneta -h for a list of command line options.
