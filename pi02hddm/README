The pi02hddm utility was written to convert an ascii file containing
the 3 momentum components of generated pi0 events into an hddm file
suitable as input to hdgeant.

This was done initially for the simulating pi0 primakoff events as
a normalization channel for the charged pion polarizability measurement.
