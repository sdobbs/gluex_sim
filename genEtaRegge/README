This program generates eta events according to Laget's production cross section
model (http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0502233).

To build, type

   scons -u install 

in the genEtaRegge directory.

To get a help message after building the executable, type genEtaRegge with no 
arguments:

  genEtaRegge: generator for eta production based on Regge trajectory formalism.
  Usage:  genEtaRegge <options>
    Options:  -N<number of events> (number of events to generate)
              -O<output.hddm>   (default: eta_gen.hddm)
              -I<input.in>      (default: eta548.in)
              -R<run number>    (default: 9000)
              -h                (Print this message and exit.)
  Coupling constants, photon beam energy range, and eta decay products are
  specified in the <input.in> file.

The decay products are specified by their GEANT ids; the four-momenta are 
generated according to n-body phase space.

Note that currently the width parameter in the specification of the decaying 
particle is not being used.

To generate events with an incoherent bremsstrahlung distribution, set the 
coherent peak position to a value less than Emin.
