// Random number generator used in mcsmear. All random numbers
// should come from the global "gDRandom" object declared here.
//
// Because we want to record the seeds used for every event,
// we use the TRandom2 class. This one has only 3 seed values
// (as opposed to 24 for TRandom1 and 624 for TRandom3) but 
// is fast with a large period (10^26).
//
// Because the seeds in TRandom2 are declared protected in
// the class with no methods to access/set them, we derive
// a new class, DRandom2 from TRandom2. This allows us access
// to the numbers for easy recording/retrieving.
