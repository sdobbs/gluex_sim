This plugin will extract reconstructed particle
parameters and write them to an HDDM file that
can then be used as input to a simulation job.
For now, it only deals with charged tracks. The
simplest usage example is:

> hd_ana -PPLUGINS=recon2mc hd_rawdata_002931_002.evio


A few configuration parameters exist that can be
used to filter which tracks are written. These are:

OUTFILENAME  Filename for output HDDM file

MIN_FOM      Minimum tracking FOM for track to be
             passed to output

MIN_P        Minimum reconstructed track momentum in
             GeV/c for track to be passed to output

MAX_P        Maximum reconstructed track momentum in
             GeV/c for track to be passed to output

PIDLIST      Comma separated list of GEANT particle
             numbers indicating types of particles to
				 keep. Empty string means keep them all
				 (probably not what you want)

VERTEX       Comma separated vertex coordinates in cm.
             If empty (default) the reconstructed vertex
				 is used.


Usually, one will want to filter on the particle
type. Otherwise, all mass hypotheses will be written
out resulting in multiple tracks on top of one another.

The VERTEX parameter is provided in case you would like
to force all particles to come from a specific location
(e.g. the center of the target). Otherwise, the single
track reconstructed vertex will be used.

If you want to apply other criteria to filter out
events or tracks you will need to modify the 
JEventProcessor_recon2mc.cc file. There is a comment
block in the evnt() method that indicates the best
place to do this.
