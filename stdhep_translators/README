These translators existed in the sim-recon base for many years until
they were retired in March 2017 as part of a clean up effort to remove
unused or obsolete code.

They have been reinstated in Feb. 2018 since a use case emerged that
could make use of them. Note that the itape conversion programs were 
not resurrected.

Note also that these make use of cernlib and so are implmented as an
optional build. 


Below is the original README file contents

See CVS package HDMS_mcfast/README for more
details. This package is used by mcfast.
