   This directory contains the code for PYTHIA and tools to run it
   The main program: run_pyth.f

   a) Compile PYTHIA:
      > make
      makes run_pyth.exe

   b) PYTHIA input files:
      run.input - one line to define the number of events to simulate and the beam energy
      pythia-geant.map - mapping GEANT<->PYTHIA particle codes
      pythia.dat - redefinitions of PYTHIA flags (do not change unless you know what you are doing)

   c) Running PYTHIA:
      > ./run_pyth.exe
      An output binary file pytout.dat is written. It contains
      all relevant info for each event - the PYTHIA record and the GEANT code

   d) read_pout.f - a code to read the PYTHIA output file and print several events
      >./read_pout.exe
      Note, that the 7-th column contains the GEANT particle code for the entry.
      For the non-zero entries: call GSKINE
     the code can be compiled: g77 -o read_pout.exe read_pout.f
